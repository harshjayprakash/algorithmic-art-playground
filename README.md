## Overview

The "Algorithmic Art Playground" is an application designed for users to experiment with
generating art through the power of programming. As a part of my dissertation project, I
developed this tool as both an educational resource for those learning about algmorithmic
approaches to creativity and a personal cavas where you can experiment with code-based
visuals on your local desktop machine.

## Compilation and Execution

The Maven build tool was utilised for handling dependencies, development and deployment.
Most IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode and NetBeans support Maven. This project requires
Java 17 or newer.
